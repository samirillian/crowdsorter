 * This is where custom routes go! WordPress, of course, has a lot of routes (to posts, pages, etc.) configured out of the box. 
 * For simple stuff "routing," just dropping shortcodes into pages works. But this can be quite unpredictable.
 * This Router is a wrapper around the WP Rest API.
 * But this is for defining all the HTTP stuff without using clunky hooks like admin_post etc.
 * Just a lot more scalable for a larger application.
